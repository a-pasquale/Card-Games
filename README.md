#Blackjack
A simple blackjack game implemented in ruby.

##About
I developed this game as part of a tutorial to teach the [ruby] [ruby] programming language.

It is built using the [sinatra] [sinatra] web framework, the [haml] [haml] templating language, and uses [redis] [redis] to persist the game data.  

You can see it deployed on heroku [here] [deployed].
